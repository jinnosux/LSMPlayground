# Ideas Checklist / Wishlist
TO DO:
- [x] Cayo Perico island - Jinno
- [x] Weapon Loadout (/ws all) - Fetu
- [x] Update to newest DLC version - jinno
- [ ] Make All .lua script manifests versions consistent - jinno
- [ ] CnR:NG like commands (/me /fart /cry...) - moviEmaker
- [ ] Teleport command (/tp [player nickname or ID]) - Fetu



# Long Term Idea:

### Battle Royale mod ?
Create a Battle Royale-like script where all players would free roam until timer goes down.
Than, all players will be teleported in an airplane flying towards Cayo perico.
Upon arriving near cayo perico, press F to jump out of airplane (if players dont press anything, throw them away near end of island).
Players should find weapons/armors around, and shoot each other until there's 1 winner. Dead players could either spectate remaining players, or spawn back to city to freeroam until next round

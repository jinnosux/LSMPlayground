# LSM Playground Fivem Server

This is a repo with resources for FiveM server `LSMplayground.com`<br />
Currently, it contains all the resources we are adding to the server<br />
Our goal is to practice coding and other aspects of running a FiveM server<br />

[Ideas for future scripts](IDEAS.md)

## To Connect to server:
 - Launch [FiveM](https://fivem.net/)
 - Press F8 to open console
 - type `connect lsmplayground.com`
 - voila
  
## Resources:
### Our Own:
- CarComand : simple lua script to spawn cars (usage: /car [car name])
- headtag : players nickname and ID above
- help : moviemaker's commands script - WIP
- teleport : Fetu's teleport script - WIP
- weapon_loadout : script to give player all weapons (usage: /ws all)

### Others:
- [custom_cars](https://github.com/PLOKMJNB/FiveM-Civ-Car-Pack) : about ~130 random car models (removed some of the heavy models)
- [hologramspeed](https://github.com/kasuganosoras/hologramspeed) : best speedometer in the world. a bit buggy though, needs further fixing
- [nos](resources/nos/README.md) : Nitrous Oxide Whippits needs baloons for consuming. 10/10 mod
- [playerblip](https://github.com/ItsAras/FiveM_Player_Blips) : visible blips of all online players on minimap/map. needs hp/armor
- [playerlist](https://github.com/TGRHavoc/fivem-playerlist) : list of all players online. needs further visual work
- [vMenu](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu) : vmenu mod, only changes being to `vMenu/config/addons.json` to load custom car models

## When Connected:
 - press [M] to access vMenu (and spawn cars/peds, teleport, change weather etc)
 - press [alt] for nitrous
 - use [/s] to enable/disable speedometer
 - use [/ws all] to get all weapons
 - have fun :)

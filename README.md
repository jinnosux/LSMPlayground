# LSM Playground Fivem Server

This is a repo with resources for FiveM server `LSMplayground.com`
Currently, it contains only external resources we are adding to the server

## Resources:
- CarComand : simple lua script to spawn cars (usage: /car [car name])
- EasyAdmin : simple Admin Dashboard (usage: /easyadmin) - currently useless. might deprecate
- hologramspeed : best speedometer in the world. a bit buggy though, needs further fixing
- nos : Nitrous Oxide, taken from [insert credits here]
- playerblip : lua visible blips of all online players on minimap/map
- playerlist : lua list of all players online
- vMenu : vmenu mod, only changes being to `vMenu/config/addons.json` to load new cars

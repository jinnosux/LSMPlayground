Currently, it contains only external resources we are adding to the server

## Resources:
- CarComand : simple lua script to spawn cars (usage: /car [car name])
- EasyAdmin : simple Admin Dashboard (usage: /easyadmin) - currently useless. might deprecate

- nos : Nitrous Oxide, taken from [insert credits here]
- playerblip : lua visible blips of all online players on minimap/map
- playerlist : lua list of all players online

# LSM Playground Fivem Server

This is a repo with resources for FiveM server `LSMplayground.com`<br />
Currently, it contains only external resources we are adding to the server<br />
Our goal is to practice coding and other aspects of running a FiveM server.<br />

[Ideas for future scripts](IDEAS)

## Resources:
- CarComand : simple lua script to spawn cars (usage: /car [car name])
- custom_cars : about ~130 random car models
- help : moviemaker's script (usage: /help)
- hologramspeed : best speedometer in the world. a bit buggy though, needs further fixing
- [nos](resources/nos/README.md) : Nitrous Oxide Whippits needs baloons for consuming
- playerblip : visible blips of all online players on minimap/map
- playerlist : list of all players online
- vMenu : vmenu mod, only changes being to `vMenu/config/addons.json` to load custom car models
- weapon_loadout : script to give player all weapons (usage: /ws all)

## To Connect to server:
 - Launch [FiveM](https://fivem.net/)
 - Press F8 to open console
 - type `connect lsmplayground.com`
 - voila

## When Connected:
 - type [/help] (credits - moviEmaker)
 - press [M] to access vMenu (and spawn cars/peds, teleport, change weather etc)
 - press [alt] for nitrous
 - use [/s] to enable/disable speedometer
 - have fun :)
